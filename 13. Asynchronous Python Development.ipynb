    "- __Synchronous:__ actions that happen one after another. Programming as we've seen it until now is synchronous, because each line executes after the previous one.\n",
    "- __Asynchronous:__ actions that don't necessary happen after one another, or that can happen in arbitrary order (\"without synchrony\").\n",
    "- __Concurrency:__ The ability of our programs to run things in different order every time the program runs, without affecting the final outcome.\n",
    "- __Parallelism:__ Running two or more things at the same time.\n",
    "- __Thread:__ A line of code execution that can run in one of your computer's cores.\n",

    "## Dining Philosopher\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Case:__ 5 philosophers and 2 forks who are hungry. The are able to eat just using 2 forks.  \n",
    "- __Solution:__ If there is a waiter (master, orquestrator), he can get the 2 forks and send them to the philosophers in a limited time for them to eat.\n",
    "It will be possible to feed 2 philopher by time, and the others would need to wait for their turn (__time slicing__).\n",
    "Even decreasing the time, it will never be possible for all of them to eat at the same time.  \n",

    "Generally, each unit of core has 4 cores inside it.\n",
    "Each core can work independently and communicate with each other, performing mathematical operations.\n",
    "Cores are \"philosophers\" with resources (forks).\n",
    "\n",
