    "# What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An Application Programming Interface (API) allows two systems to communicate with one another. An API essentially provides the language and contract for how two systems interact. Each API has documentation and specifications which determine how information can be transferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a webpage is rendered, APIs can use HTTP requests to get information from a web application or web server.  \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are typically categorized as either SOAP or REST and both are used to access web services. SOAP relies solely on XML to provide messaging services, while REST offers a more lightweight method, using URLs in most cases to receive or send information. REST uses four different HTTP 1.1 verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike SOAP, REST doesn’t have to use XML to provide the response. You can find REST-based Web services that output the data in Command Separated Value (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Really Simple Syndication (RSS). The point is that you can obtain the output you need in a form that’s easy to parse within the language you need for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be used to:\n",
    "- Integrate with third party APIs\n",
    "- Build APIs for internal use\n",
    "- Build APIs and expose APIs for external use\n",

    "# What is an Endpoint?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, an endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs work using ‘requests’ and ‘responses.’ When an API requests information from a web application or web server, it will receive a response. The place that APIs send requests and where the resource lives, is called an endpoint.\n",

    "All over the world, companies leverage APIs to transfer vital information, processes, transactions, and more. API usage will only increase as time goes on, and making sure that each touchpoint in API communication is intact is vital to the success of each API. Endpoints specify where resources can be accessed by APIs and play a key role in guaranteeing the correct functioning of the software that interacts with it.  In short, API performance relies on its ability to communicate effectively with API Endpoints.\n",

    "## HTTP Methods  \n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs enable you to develop any kind of web application having all possible CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations. REST guidelines suggest using a specific HTTP method on a specific type of call made to the server (though technically it is possible to violate this guideline, yet it is highly discouraged).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use below-given information to find a suitable HTTP method for the action performed by API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible methods:\n",
    "- HTTP GET\n",
    "- HTTP POST\n",
    "- HTTP PUT\n",
    "- HTTP DELETE\n",
    "- HTTP PATCH"
   ]
  },

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## HTTP GET\n",
    "Use GET requests to retrieve resource representation/information only – and not to modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change the state of the resource, these are said to be safe methods. Additionally, GET APIs should be idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests must produce the same result every time until another API (POST or PUT) has changed the state of the resource on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given HTTP GET API, if the resource is found on the server, then it must return HTTP response code 200 (OK) – along with the response body, which is usually either XML or JSON content (due to their platform-independent nature).\n",
    "\n",
    "In case resource is NOT found on server then it must return HTTP response code 404 (NOT FOUND). Similarly, if it is determined that GET request itself is not correctly formed then server will return HTTP response code 400 (BAD REQUEST).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example request URIs:  \n",
    "HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users  \n",
    "HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users?size=20&page=5  \n",
    "HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users/123  \n",
    "HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users/123/address  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP POST\n",
    "Use POST APIs to create new subordinate resources, e.g., a file is subordinate to a directory containing it or a row is subordinate to a database table. Talking strictly in terms of REST, POST methods are used to create a new resource into the collection of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, if a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be HTTP response code 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location header.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, the action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either HTTP response code 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that POST is neither safe nor idempotent, and invoking two identical POST requests will result in two different resources containing the same information (except resource ids).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example request URIs  \n",
    "HTTP POST http://www.appdomain.com/users  \n",
    "HTTP POST http://www.appdomain.com/users/123/accounts  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP PUT\n",
    "Use PUT APIs primarily to update existing resource (if the resource does not exist, then API may decide to create a new resource or not). If a new resource has been created by the PUT API, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the HTTP response code 201 (Created) response and if an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the POST and PUT APIs can be observed in request URIs. POST requests are made on resource collections, whereas PUT requests are made on an individual resource.  \n",
    "Example request URIs  \n",
    "HTTP PUT http://www.appdomain.com/users/123  \n",
    "HTTP PUT http://www.appdomain.com/users/123/accounts/456  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP DELETE\n",
    "As the name applies, DELETE APIs are used to delete resources (identified by the Request-URI).\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful response of DELETE requests SHOULD be HTTP response code 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has been queued, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been performed but the response does not include an entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE operations are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it’s removed from the collection of resources. Repeatedly calling DELETE API on that resource will not change the outcome – however, calling DELETE on a resource a second time will return a 404 (NOT FOUND) since it was already removed. Some may argue that it makes the DELETE method non-idempotent. It’s a matter of discussion and personal opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example request URIs  \n",
    "HTTP DELETE http://www.appdomain.com/users/123  \n",
    "HTTP DELETE http://www.appdomain.com/users/123/accounts/456  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP PATCH\n",
    "HTTP PATCH requests are to make partial update on a resource. If you see PUT requests also modify a resource entity so to make more clear – PATCH method is the correct choice for partially updating an existing resource and PUT should only be used if you’re replacing a resource in its entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that there are some challenges if you decide to use PATCH APIs in your application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Support for PATCH in browsers, servers, and web application frameworks is not universal. IE8, PHP, Tomcat, Django, and lots of other software has missing or broken support for it.  \n",
    "Request payload of PATCH request is not straightforward as it is for PUT request. e.g.  \n",
    "HTTP GET /users/1  \n",
    "\n",
    "produces below response:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{id: 1, username: 'admin', email: 'email@example.org'}`\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample patch request to update the email will be like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP PATCH /users/1  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`[\n",
    "{ “op”: “replace”, “path”: “/email”, “value”: “new.email@example.org” }\n",
    "]`  \n",
    "\n",
    "There may be following possible operations are per the HTTP specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "`[\n",
    "{ \"op\": \"test\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", \"value\": \"foo\" },\n",
    "{ \"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\" },\n",
    "{ \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", \"value\": [ \"foo\", \"bar\" ] },\n",
    "{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", \"value\": 42 },\n",
    "{ \"op\": \"move\", \"from\": \"/a/b/c\", \"path\": \"/a/b/d\" },\n",
    "{ \"op\": \"copy\",\t\"from\": \"/a/b/d\", \"path\": \"/a/b/e\" }\n",
    "]`\n",
    "\n",
    "PATCH method is not a replacement for the POST or PUT methods. It applies a delta (diff) rather than replacing the entire resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of HTTP Methods for RESTful APIs\n",
    "The below table summarises the use of HTTP methods discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "| HTTP METHOD | \tCRUD\t| ENTIRE COLLECTION (E.G. /USERS)\t| SPECIFIC ITEM (E.G. /USERS/123)| \n",
    "| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n",
    "| POST | Create | 201 (Created), ‘Location’ header with link to /users/{id} containing new ID. | Avoid using POST on single resource|\n",
    "| GET | Read | 200 (OK), list of users. Use pagination, sorting and filtering to navigate big lists. | 200 (OK), single user. 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.|\n",
    "| PUT | Update/Replace | 405 (Method not allowed), unless you want to update every resource in the entire collection of resource. | 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). Use 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.|\n",
    "| PATCH | Partial Update/Modify | 405 (Method not allowed), unless you want to modify the collection itself. | 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). Use 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.|\n",
    "| DELETE | Delete | 405 (Method not allowed), unless you want to delete the whole collection — use with caution. | 200 (OK). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.|\n",

    "## Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safe Methods\n",
    "As per HTTP specification, the GET and HEAD methods should be used only for retrieval of resource representations – and they do not update/delete the resource on the server. Both methods are said to be considered “safe“.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested – and they can update/delete the resource on server and so should be used carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Idempotent Methods\n",
    "The term idempotent is used more comprehensively to describe an operation that will produce the same results if executed once or multiple times. Idempotence is a handy property in many situations, as it means that an operation can be repeated or retried as often as necessary without causing unintended effects. With non-idempotent operations, the algorithm may have to keep track of whether the operation was already performed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In HTTP specification, The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE are declared idempotent methods. Other methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, so both are also inherently idempotent.  \n",
